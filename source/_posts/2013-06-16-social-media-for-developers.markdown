I've been living under a rock for the last 2 years.
---------------------------------------------------
I've just finished a tour of duty with a rigid, humorless financial institution that blocked virtually all forms of social media. Actually, they blocked any website I use on a daily basis. The Google suite, Facebook, Twitter... you get the picture. Know your role.

And so it went... fake Facebook name so "the man" wouldn't be able to find me. I wasn't even LinkedIn with my friends and colleagues in our little version of North Korea. That is, until I dropped the mic after my farewell speech. 

New Beginnings
--------------
So I'm learning now.

Better late than never, everyone seems to say. 

We've had some great speakers in class at The Flatiron School, and I've noticed that the developer world communicates via social media. I'm suspect all of the instructors at The Flatiron School knew each other's "handles" before meeting in real life. Even I, a social media neanderthal, followed Sandi Metz before I knew how awesome she was (or why I should think she's awesome). 

Indeed, everything seems to revolve around blogs, micro-blogs, and micro-micro blogs (if that exists). It's daunting; I mean, what's a caveman to do?

So let's chop it up for the social media impaired, and see where it takes us. 

### What I Use
My current beginner's cocktail is LinkedIn and Twitter, and of course, our sweet, sweet Octopress. Although I'm sure I'm using Twitter wrong, TweetDeck is awesome. It's a command center that shows me how I've followed too many people, published almost zero content, and have a paltry amount of followers (on a totally unrelated note). All joking aside, Twitter is a great outlet for my opinions as a green bean developer. It's a resourceful tool to follow well-known developers and network with those in the Silicon Alley startup scene. 

LinkedIn has been also been great as far as job inquiries and introductions are concerned, plus I find it very easy to use.

As far as Octopress is concerned, you're reading it. More to come as I become a markdown master.

Here are a few tips and screenshots that have helped me employ TweetDeck to effectively manage my web presence:
My column setup is as follows:

Timeline - Activity - Interactions - Tweets - Search: "@FlatironSchool" - Search: "@shtavisays"

I like this setup; the content is arranged from left to right scaling from public to personal interests. I find search columns to be particularly useful as they allow me to receive feeds based on hash tags or mentions. In the screenshot below, I have two search columns set up to find mentions of @FlatironSchool and @shtavisays.

###Forget @shtavisays, Look at How Avi Tweets
For starters, Avi has employed a succinct bounty of information in his bio without cracking 200 characters. Current pursuits, past endeavors, personal links, you name it. I'll be updating my current Jay-Z-quote-starter-bio as soon as I'm done with this post ("Drink Cris Out the Bottle, Eat Popeyes for Dinner").

Now that I've pointed out the obvious, here's the rest. Avi, like Jeff Casimir, Gwen Bell, and Sandi Metz, uses Twitter as an all-purpose outlet. It's a mix of the personal and professional, a swiss-army knife to get the thought across whatever that may be. I've seen Twitter get speakers to come to The Flatiron School, and help students interact with big names within the tech community. I'm excited to leave my caveman days behind me.
