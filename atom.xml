    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>A retrospective of problematic projects (Rubyconf Brazil 2012)</h2>

<p>I am currently a student at The Flatiron School, learning how to develop for the internetz in Ruby/Ruby on Rails. We were given an assignment to checkout a Ruby-related slide deck on Speaker Deck and drop some knowledge via blog. Here&rsquo;s mine:</p>

<p>My <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/danielvlopes/a-retrospective-of-problematic-projects-rubyconf-brazil-2012">deck of choice</a> was this presentations by Daniel Lopes at RubyConf Brazil 2012.</p>

<p>What drew me to this presentation you may ask? Well I&rsquo;ll ask you a couple questions in return&hellip; What are problematic projects? What&rsquo;s it like to read a technical presentation in Portuguese? What is RubyConf Brazil like?</p>

<h3>Topics Touched on this Presentation:</h3>

<pre><code>+Best Practices  
  +SCRUM  
+Rails Best Practices  
+Control Levels:  
  +Individual  
  +Team  
  +Outside of Control  
+DRY &amp; Automation  
+Creation -&gt; Launch -&gt; Maintenance  
+Automated Tests  
+What Should I Test?  
+Agile: Team &amp; client on the same page, maintaining flexibility  
</code></pre>

<p>Daniel&rsquo;s slides from RubyConf Brazil 2012 focused on common project issues, good workflow and best practices. Definitely had to look a bunch of these buzzwords up. But, I think it&rsquo;s great to start thinking about how other developers work in groups and how product is created. So here are some of the things I gleaned:</p>

<h3>Takeaways (Slides Only)</h3>

<p>Three control levels exist: we have control over things as individuals, as a team, and sometimes we have no control at all. It is important to be congnizant of these control levels and to behave accordingly. That which we have the most control over is in the individual scope.</p>

<p>As for DRY (Don&rsquo;t Repeat Yourself) and Automation, it is Daniel&rsquo;s view that there can be too much if these things are done without vision and specificity. I&rsquo;d like to know more about automation in this context.</p>

<p>What Should I Test? This was probably the most helpful section for me. There  are some great quotes from Kent Beck in the slides to illustrate the point:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&hellip;my philosophy is to test as little as possible to reach a given level of confidence&hellip;&rdquo;
-and-
&ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t typically make a kind of mistake, I don&rsquo;t test for it&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Basically there is such a thing as too much testing, so testing should be focused and principled.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Ruby Conference Brazil is the largest Ruby conference in Latin America, with more than 750 attendees and almost as many online participants. Lots of influential speakers from international ruby community like Chad Fowler and Yehuda Katz have made the journey; I&rsquo;m definitely doing this in the future.</p>

<p>Ruby is a beautiful and universal language; reading this presentation with my intermediate Portuguese skillz was a pleasure (and thank you for making it interesting and for writing the difficult concepts in English, Daniel).</p>

<p>Helpful diagram to illustrate the effects of excessive DRY &amp; Automation:
